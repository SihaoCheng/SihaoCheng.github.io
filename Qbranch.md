## A Cooling Anamaly of High-Mass White Dwarfs

We discovered anomaly in the cooling process of high-mass white dwarf stars. 
The "trafic jam" created by this anomaly can explain properties of the "Q branch", 
an unexpected branch-like feature revealed by the data of Gaia satellite. 
This anomaly is an extra delay of cooling in addition to the delay of crystallization. 
The settling of 22Ne in white dwarfs may account for the physical origin of this extra delay. 
Here is [our paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1905.12710) and the catalog of selected white dwarfs:
