I love classical music, especially compositions by Bach, Mozart, Beethoven, Schubert, and Chopin. I tried to expand my taste, but not yet sucessfully. Perhaps that will happen naturally some day in future. I started to learn playing the piano at the time of primary school, and the violin at high school, though I don't know for sure how much progress I have made till now. Recently I also found recorder a beautiful instrument! (the figure below is from Yamaha's website)
