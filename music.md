# Music! Classical Music! 

Music is a magic. I love classical music, especially compositions by Bach, Mozart, Beethoven, Schubert, and Chopin. I tried to expand my taste, but not yet sucessfully. Perhaps that will happen naturally some day in future. By the way, I think my taste of scientific work is very similar to my musical taste.

I started to learn playing the piano at the time of primary school, and the violin at high school, though I don't know for sure how much progress I have made till now. Recently I also found recorder a beautiful instrument! (the figure below is from Yamaha's website)

Below I list some recordings I was listening recently and love so much. I hope my readers who come across this page will resonate. I will update this list regularly.

Bach played by a brilliant Chinese pianist, Yuan Sheng (盛原, once studied with [Rosalyn Tureck](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rosalyn_Tureck) in the US):

Beethoven piano concerto ("Emperor", No. 5) played by Glenn Gould, Leopold Stokowski, and the American Symphony Orchestra. I first listened to this recording in junior high school, and (fortunately or unfortunately) it became my stereotype of this concerto:
