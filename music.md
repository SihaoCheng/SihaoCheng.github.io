# Music! Classical Music! 

Music is a magic. I love classical music, especially compositions by Bach, Mozart, Beethoven, Schubert, and Chopin. I tried to expand my taste, but not yet sucessfully. Perhaps that will happen naturally some day in future. By the way, I think my taste of scientific work is very similar to my musical taste.

I started to learn playing the piano at the time of primary school, and the violin at high school, though I don't know for sure how much progress I have made till now. Recently I also found recorder a beautiful instrument! (the figure below is from Yamaha's website)

Below I list some recordings I was listening recently and love so much. I hope my readers who come across this page will resonate. I will update this list regularly.

Bach played by Glenn Gould. I also just watched a documentary about [Gould](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pL9YjM1BqgY), which is so inspiring and encouraging.

Mozart's piano concerto played by Maurizio Pollini, with Karl Bohm and the Wiener Philharmoniker. I bought a CD of this performance in Japan ten years ago. I'm surprised I can find its video on youtube!

Bach played by a brilliant Chinese pianist, [Yuan Sheng](https://www.bach-cantatas.com/Bio/Sheng-Yuan.htm) (盛原, once studied with [Rosalyn Tureck](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rosalyn_Tureck) in the US).

Beethoven piano concerto ("Emperor", No. 5) played by [Glenn Gould](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glenn_Gould), [Leopold Stokowski](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leopold_Stokowski), and the [American Symphony Orchestra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Symphony_Orchestra). I first listened to this recording in junior high school, and (fortunately or unfortunately) it became my stereotype of this concerto.
