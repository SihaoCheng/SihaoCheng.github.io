# Double-White-Dwarf Merger Products among White Dwarfs

A double-WD mergers may produce a new white dwarf with a higher mass. Compared to other high-mass white dwarfs, these merger products have higher velocity dispersion because they are older and according to the age-velocity-dispersion relation of the Milky-Way disc, older stars have higher velocity dispersion. We make use of this kinematic signature of double-WD merger products to estimate their amount. Then, we are also able to estimate the merger rate of these systems and its implication for the progenitor problem of type-Ia supernovae.

## High-mass white dwarfs

<br>
From Gaia Data Release 2 data, we select a 250 pc sample of high-mass, hot white dwarfs, avoiding those on the 'Q branch' (see here). In total we have got 1380 objects for our kinematic analysis.

## Velocity distribution

<br>
The distribution of transverse velocity distribution from Gaia data. If the fraction of double-WD merger (f_m) is 0 %, then the distribution should follow the black, dashed curves. The observed excess (data points with error bars) can be used to estimate f_m.

## Fraction of double-WD merger products (fm)

<br>
Using the velocity distribution, we estimate fm in five mass bins.

## Merger rates

<br>
Then, we calculate the double-WD merger rate as a function of the total mass of the two white dwarfs. Our estimates add significant precision and mass resolution to our knowledge of the merger rate.
