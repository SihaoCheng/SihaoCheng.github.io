I am Sihao Cheng, a third-year graduate student of astrophysics at the Johns Hopkins Univerisity ([JHU](https://physics-astronomy.jhu.edu)). I love physics, math, classical music, kendo, and anime.

## Research

I am interested in solving astrophysical questions with statistical analysis of survey data. Using data from the [_Gaia_](https://www.cosmos.esa.int/web/gaia/home) space mission, I have been working on explaining an unexpected slowing-down of [white dwarf](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_dwarf) cooling and on double-white-dwarf mergers, which is related to [type-Ia supernovae](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_Ia_supernova). I am also working on developing a statistical tool to extract more information from the [filament structures](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Observable_universe#Large-scale_structure) of the universe.

### An anomaly of white dwarf cooling

![](https://pages.jh.edu/~scheng40/Qbranch/images/Qbranch.png)
We discovered a cooling anomaly in 6% of high-mass white dwarf stars, which creates the "Q branch" feature on the Hertzsprung-Russell diagram of white dwarfs. The gradual settling of the neutron-rich 22Ne in these white dwarfs may provide the energy required by this anomaly. Visit [this page](https://sihaocheng.github.io/Qbranch) and [our paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1905.12710) for details about this cooling anomaly and more animations.

### The double-white-dwarf merger rate

![](https://pages.jh.edu/~scheng40/DWDmerger/images/merger_rate1.png)
Two white dwarfs orbiting each other may merge. We use the amount of merger products among high-mass white dwarfs to estimate the merger rate. Our estimates add significant precision and mass resolution to previous estimates. Visit [this page](https://sihaocheng.github.io/DWDmerger) and [our paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1910.09558) for details about our method and results.
