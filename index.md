I am Sihao Cheng, a third-year graduate student of astrophysics at the Johns Hopkins Univerisity ([JHU](https://physics-astronomy.jhu.edu)). I love physics, math, classical music, kendo, and anime.

### Research

I am interested in solving astrophysical questions with statistical analysis of survey data. Using data from the [_Gaia_](https://www.cosmos.esa.int/web/gaia/home) space mission, I have been working on explaining an unexpected slowing-down of [white dwarf](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_dwarf) cooling and on double-white-dwarf mergers, which is related to [type-Ia supernovae](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_Ia_supernova). I am also working on developing a statistical tool to extract more information from the [filament structures](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Observable_universe#Large-scale_structure) of the universe.
