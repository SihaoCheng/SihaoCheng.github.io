I am a third-year graduate student of astrophysics at the Johns Hopkins Univerisity ([JHU](https://physics-astronomy.jhu.edu)). I love physics, math, classical music, kendo, and anime.

# Research
I am interested in solving astrophysical questions with statistical analysis of survey data. Using data from the [_Gaia_](https://www.cosmos.esa.int/web/gaia/home) space mission, I have been working on explaining an unexpected slowing-down of [white dwarf](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_dwarf) cooling and on double-white-dwarf mergers, which is related to [type-Ia supernovae](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_Ia_supernova). While working on white dwarfs, I built a python 3 package [`WD_models`](https://github.com/SihaoCheng/WD_models) containing tools to calculate white dwarf photometry and other physical properties based on cooling and atmosphere models.

I am also working on developing a statistical tool to extract more information from the [filament structures](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Observable_universe#Large-scale_structure) of the universe. Using a new set of statistical descriptors, called wavelet scattering transform coefficients, on the observable [weak lensing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weak_gravitational_lensing) maps, we could extract more cosmological information so as to obtain a better constraint on the total amount of matter and the density fluctuation of the universe.



## The double-white-dwarf merger rate
Two white dwarfs orbiting each other may merge. We use the amount of merger products among high-mass white dwarfs to estimate the merger rate. Our estimates add significant precision and mass resolution to previous estimates. Visit [this page](https://sihaocheng.github.io/DWDmerger) and [our paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1910.09558) for details about our method and results.

## An anomaly of white dwarf cooling
We discovered a cooling anomaly in 6% of high-mass white dwarf stars, which creates the "Q branch" feature on the Hertzsprung-Russell diagram of white dwarfs. The gradual settling of the neutron-rich 22Ne in these white dwarfs may provide the energy required by this anomaly. Visit [this page](https://sihaocheng.github.io/Qbranch) and [our paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1905.12710) for details about this cooling anomaly and more animations.
