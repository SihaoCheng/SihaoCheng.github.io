I am a third-year graduate student of astrophysics at the Johns Hopkins Univerisity ([JHU](https://physics-astronomy.jhu.edu)). I love physics, math, classical music, kendo, and anime.

# Research
I am interested in solving astrophysical problems with statistical analysis of survey data. Using data from the [_Gaia_](https://www.cosmos.esa.int/web/gaia/home) space mission, I discovered some [white dwarfs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_dwarf) with extremely low cooling rate and some as double-white-dwarf merger products, which is related to [type-Ia supernovae](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_Ia_supernova) explosion. While working on white dwarfs, I built a python 3 package [`WD_models`](https://github.com/SihaoCheng/WD_models) containing tools to transform between white dwarf photometry and physical properties, based on existing white dwarf models. My work has led to two papers, one of which was highlighted by astrobites and [AAS](https://aasnova.org/2019/11/19/the-slowly-cooling-white-dwarfs-who-say-ne/).

I am also working on developing a statistical tool to extract more information from the [filament structures](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Observable_universe#Large-scale_structure) of the universe. Using a new set of statistical descriptors, called wavelet scattering transform coefficients, of the observable [weak lensing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weak_gravitational_lensing) maps, we could extract more cosmological information so as to obtain a better constraint on the total amount of matter and the density fluctuation of the universe.

## Some white dwarfs merge together
Two white dwarfs orbiting each other may merge. We use the amount of merger products among high-mass white dwarfs to estimate the merger rate. Our estimates add significant precision and mass resolution to previous estimates. Visit [this page](https://sihaocheng.github.io/DWDmerger) and [our paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1910.09558) for details about our method and results.

## Some white dwarfs cool extremely slowly
We discovered a cooling anomaly in 6% of high-mass white dwarf stars, which creates the "Q branch" feature on the Hertzsprung-Russell diagram of white dwarfs. The gradual settling of the neutron-rich 22Ne in these white dwarfs may provide the energy required by this anomaly. Visit [this page](https://sihaocheng.github.io/Qbranch) and [our paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1905.12710) for details about this cooling anomaly and more animations.
