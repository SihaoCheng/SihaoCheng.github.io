# a clear, flat view of stellar motion with Gaia

Using two new techniques, I am mapping the phase space with unprecedented sharpness and uniformity. 

The figure below illustrates that "slicing" the phase space provides much clearer view of the structures in the high dimension phase space, compared to the commonly used "projection" (marginalization) method.

In this map, multiple new features are identified, including two shocking ones: 1. a tilted under-density; 2. a tilted cliff of metallicity.

Explanation of coordinates: there are in total 4D for the in-disk motions: (x, y, vx, vy), or equivalently into action-angle variables: 
(jphi, angle phi) for guiding center motion and (jr, angle r) for the epicycle motion. 
Large jphi means high angular momentum. Large jr means more eccentric orbit.

The plots shows guiding center distribution with certain epicycle parameters set by the two sliders.
